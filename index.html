  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    Hey there!
    I'm Odysseus Abraham Kirikopoulos, currently studying at the General Lyceum of Epanomi in Greece.
    Technology and programming are my passions,
    and I'm deeply involved in various projects to broaden my understanding and skills in these areas.

    I'm proud to be one of the Co-Founders of Simplified Coding,
    a nonprofit initiative aimed at making coding accessible to everyone through free resources and courses,
    all without pesky ads.
    From shaping the website's initial version
    to continuously developing new lessons and brainstorming innovative features,
    I'm fully dedicated to ensuring that learning to code is enjoyable for all.

    In addition to my work with Simplified Coding, I also serve as a Computer Science Tutor at Schoolhouse,
    where I guide students through the intricacies of Python and Web Development.
    It's incredibly fulfilling to witness the progress of students from diverse backgrounds,
    and I'm grateful for the positive feedback I've received.

    Furthermore, I'm an active member of HackOlympia, where I contribute as a Co-Leader.
    HackOlympia provides a dynamic learning environment for tech enthusiasts across Greece,
    fostering collaboration and creativity through engaging meetups and workshops.

    I'm always open
    to connecting with others to explore potential collaborations or just chat about all things tech.
    Feel free to reach out—I'm here to connect and learn together!
