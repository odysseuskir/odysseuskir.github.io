  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    My name is Odysseus Abraham Kirikopoulos, and I am currently a student at the General Lyceum of Epanomi in Greece.
    I am eager about technology and programming,
    and I engage in various activities to advance my knowledge and expertise in this area.

    <br><br>

    As Co-Founder of Simplified Coding, a non-profit initiative established in Greece in September 2022,
    I am committed to making programming accessible and enjoyable to everyone through our
    free resources and courses without ads. My contributions have been significant
    in developing the initial version of our site, creating new lessons,
    and planning innovative features for the upcoming months.
    Furthermore, I am responsible for promoting the project on social media.

    <br><br>

    Aside from my work with Simplified Coding, I also serve as a Computer Science Tutor at Schoolhouse.
    I assist students with Python and Web Development, and my dedication has impacted 29 students from 11 countries.
    Through 21 sessions, I have dedicated more than 17 hours of tutoring,
    and I have received positive feedback from my students,
    with 35 reviews marked as "Super Helpful" and 47 as "Helpful."

    <br><br>

    In addition to my role as a tutor, I am a Co-Leader at HackOlympia.
    HackOlympia is a national-wide club that fosters a dynamic learning environment through meetups and workshops.
    Thus, I am committed to making a positive impact on the future of tech enthusiasts across the country.

    <br><br>

    I am always enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded technology enthusiasts.
    If you'd like to explore potential collaborations, discuss ideas,
    or connect with me, please do not hesitate to reach out!
